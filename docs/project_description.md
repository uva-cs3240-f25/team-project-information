# CS 3240 Fall 2025 Team Project Information

## Project Overview
This semester, your class projects are all about **sustainability at UVA**!  

We care about sustainability at UVA, and we know students do too. We believe there can and should be a website/tool to help promote and support that with features such as user accounts, messaging, and general information, along with bonus features such as gamification, maps, etc.  

Your job is to perform requirements elicitation with UVA students to determine what needs there are and then design an app around those needs. This is a higher-level project where you and your team will be responsible for eliciting, analyzing, and defining requirements, while still implementing core technical features.

## Base Requirements (User Stories)
- As a **UVA student**, I should be able to **log in with my Google account** because **it ensures security and ties the app to my university identity**.  
- As a **user**, I should be able to **create and edit my own profile** because **it personalizes the experience and allows others to know who I am**.  
- As a **user**, I should be able to **send and receive messages** because **I need to communicate directly with others in the system**.  
- As a **team member**, I should be able to **store and share files using Amazon S3** because **we need scalable and reliable storage for sustainability-related resources**.  
- As a **student developer**, I should be able to **deploy the application to the web** because **real users must interact with the system during elicitation and beta testing**.

## Core Use Cases (User Stories)
- As a **student interested in sustainability**, I should be able to **discover features that promote sustainable practices at UVA** because **I want to contribute positively to my community**.  
- As a **user**, I should be able to **log in with my UVA email (via Google)** because **it verifies I’m part of the university community**.  
- As a **user**, I should be able to **update my profile with relevant information** because **others may want to collaborate with me on sustainability efforts**.  
- As a **student**, I should be able to **exchange messages with other users** because **working together is essential to supporting sustainability projects**.  
- As a **student developer**, I should be able to **elicit new sustainability-related requirements from my peers** because **the system should reflect real student needs, not just assumptions**.

## Team Roles

Each team member will take on one of the following five roles. These roles are designed to help organize the team and distribute responsibilities. While the documents this semester are team-based (rather than individual), each role still comes with expectations for leadership, contribution, and accountability.

- **Project Manager**  
  Responsible for ensuring that the team is on track with deadlines and deliverables. The PM should facilitate communication within the team, coordinate meetings, and help resolve conflicts. They should also ensure that all voices are heard during team discussions.  

- **Requirements Lead**  
  Responsible for guiding the team through requirements elicitation and documentation. This role will make sure that the team is actively gathering feedback from other UVA students and that the requirements documents and updates are clear, accurate, and complete.  

- **Development Lead**  
  Responsible for helping guide the team’s coding efforts. This role should encourage good development practices, perform code reviews, and provide technical guidance when needed. They should also ensure the team is following consistent standards for design and coding.  

- **Quality Assurance Lead**  
  Responsible for ensuring that the team is properly testing their application throughout the semester. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and beta testing. The QA lead should help the team think critically about test coverage and software quality.  

- **Configuration Manager**  
  Responsible for managing the team’s repository and ensuring that proper version control practices are followed. They should help resolve merge conflicts, set up branching strategies, and keep the repository organized.

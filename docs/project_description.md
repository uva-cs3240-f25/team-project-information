# 🌱 CS 3240 Team Project — Sustainability at UVA

## Introduction
Sustainability is one of the defining challenges of our time. From climate change to waste reduction, from food systems to energy use, our individual and collective choices have a direct impact on the world around us. At the University of Virginia, sustainability is a core commitment — our community actively seeks ways to reduce waste, conserve resources, and promote responsible stewardship of the environment.

As software engineers, we have the opportunity to build tools that make sustainability practical, approachable, and meaningful. Technology can help change behaviors, provide visibility into complex problems, and connect people around shared goals. This semester, your team will design and build a web application that encourages and supports sustainable practices at UVA.

## Why Students?
Sustainability efforts are most successful when they start at the community level. Students play a vital role in shaping campus culture, whether by choosing reusable containers, reducing food waste, carpooling to Grounds, or finding new ways to share resources. You are both the creators **and** the users of the systems we will design — your ideas, experiences, and insights will directly shape how effective these applications can be.

## Project Goals
Your team will select a specific problem area related to sustainability and develop a working application that addresses it. While your domain focus may differ from other teams, every project must meet a shared set of **technical requirements**:

- ✅ **Google Login** – All accounts must be created and managed using Google authentication.  
- ✅ **User Accounts** – Each user must have an in-app account tied to their UVA Google address.  
- ✅ **In-App Messaging** – Users must be able to communicate with one another inside the application. (Emailing outside the system does not count.)  
- ✅ **Amazon S3 Integration** – All images (e.g., profile pictures, shared content, sustainability tracking screenshots) must be uploaded to and retrieved from Amazon S3 storage.  

These features ensure a common technical foundation while allowing creativity in the sustainability problem your team chooses to tackle.

## Example Project Directions
Here are a few examples of the kinds of applications your team might design — you are not limited to these, but they illustrate the type of ideas we are looking for:

- ♻️ **Reusable Container Tracker**  
  Students log and share progress in using reusable dining containers. Leaderboards or gamification can encourage participation.  

- 🚲 **Ride-Sharing and Bike Buddy Finder**  
  Match students who want to carpool or bike together, reducing single-passenger vehicle trips to and from Grounds.  

- 🍽️ **Food Waste Reduction Tool**  
  Allow students to post when they have leftover food from meetings/events to redistribute before it’s wasted.  

- 🎮 **Sustainability Challenge App**  
  Gamify sustainable actions (turning off lights, reducing water use, recycling) with points, badges, and team competitions.  

- 📚 **Sharing Economy for Campus Resources**  
  Encourage the reuse of school supplies, textbooks, or small items by facilitating lending and borrowing across Grounds.

# Team Roles

Each member of your five person team will take on one of these roles.  Each role has different responsibilities, but ALL ROLES require that you be an active contributor to the code of the project.  In other words, if you take on Scrum Master, that doesn't mean you don't have to contribute as much code as someone else.  

__Scrum Master__ - The Scrum Master could also be called the Team Leader, but it's not really a "leader" position, per se, in that they are not making major decisions about the project itself.  The Scrum Master is responsible for keeping everyone on track, facilitating all team meetings, and monitoring team status / issues.  The course staff will come to the Scrum Master first if there are any team issues or questions, and similarly the Scrum Master needs to know what's going on with the team and can communicate with the staff if someone is falling behind, etc.

- Reasons to be the Scrum Master: You like keeping schedules; you like keeping things organized; you don't mind being the point of contact with the staff.
- Reasons not to be the Scrum Master: You are not the most organized person; you don't think you can stay on top of what the team is working on; you don't like talking to the staff.

__Requirements Lead__ - The Requirements Lead is responsible for keeping up with the features of the project.  This person will take the lead on the requirements elicitation process (which takes place in the first couple weeks of the project) as their major activity.  Note that the Requirements Manager doesn't do the whole process - they just lead the effort.  Everyone else has to participate as well!  Then throughout the semester they will manage the feature/issue tracker in GitHub, monitoring the state of the project.

- Reasons to be the Requirements Lead: You are interested in learning how requirements are created; you want to find out what your fellow students are excited about with your project; you like knowing "what's coming next" in the project.
- Reasons to not be the Requirements Lead: You have no interest in interacting with other people to find out what they want in a system; your first couple weeks of the semester are super hectic and you don't have the time for the elicitation process. 

__QA Lead__ - The QA Lead is responsible for ensuring that the system is thoroughly tested, for developing the overall testing plan/philosophy of the team, and spearheading the beta testing effort at the end of the semester.  The Testing Manager is responsible for executing beta testing at the end of the semester and creating the Beta Testing Document.  The Testing Manager is also responsible for overseeing the testing philosophy throughout the semester, ensuring unit tests are being written.  Note that the Testing Manager does _not_ write every test case in the system - they just keep up with what everyone else is doing and lend support as needed.

- Reasons to be the QA Lead: You want to learn more about testing procedures; you love seeing that unit test result bar turn green; you took HCI or something similar and are interested in setting up user testing.
- Reasons not to be the QA Lead: You don't see the value in writing tests; you don't want to work with your fellow students in doing in-person testing. 

__DevOps Lead__ - The DevOps Lead is the support tech for the team in a sense.  They are responsible for the management and support of all the systems we are using in the class, namely GitHub, GitHub Actions, Amazon S3, and Heroku.  They should be a person that is relatively comfortable tinkering with computers and settings.  The DevOps Manager does not have to have all the answers, but would be the contact person for going to the staff to get help on any particular issues.  The DevOps Manager does need to have access to a credit card for setting up the various accounts for the team.

- Reasons to be the DevOps Lead: You are familiar with the tools mentioned already, or you are really interested in learning more about them; you like to tinker with settings to get things working "just right"; you have the patience to help those on your team who might need assistance getting their environments working.
- Reasons not to be the DevOps Lead: You do not feel comfortable helping others with technical issues; you are very unfamiliar with the tools above and would rather just have a "turnkey" solution for doing your work this semester.

__Development Lead__ - Responsible for helping guide the teamâ€™s coding efforts. This role should encourage good development practices, perform code reviews, and provide technical guidance when needed. They should also ensure the team is following consistent standards for design and coding.   

- Reasons to be the Development Lead: You enjoy solving a puzzle using critical thinking and you are interested in how software is put together.
- Reasons not to be the Development Lead: You hate troubleshooting code. 

__Sixth Team Member__ - If your team has 6 members, the member without a role listed above should come to office hours with the professor to discuss options.  The role will be determined based on interest and needs of the team.

__Only Four Team Members__ - If your team only has 4 members due to the number of students in the course or because a student drops, the role that should be left out is _Development Lead._  All other roles must still be filled.

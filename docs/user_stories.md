# Base User Stories

These user stories are intended to ensure that all projects have a base level of functionality and similarity between them for grading perposes and to ensure you have experience with various third-party APIs.

_Format: “As a [role], I should be able to [do something] because [reason].”_

## 1) Authentication & Accounts (Google Sign-In)

- As a student, I should be able to **edit my profile** (name, short bio, sustainability interests) because teammates and peers need to know who I am.
- As a student, I should be able to **upload a profile image stored in S3** because visuals help others recognize me.

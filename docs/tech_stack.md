## Web Design Resources

* Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2021 Quick Reference: [https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)
* Four basic principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust
* Semantic & Accessible HTML on MDN: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML)
* Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Reference on MDN: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)
Use ARIA only in cases that aren't covered by HTML 5 semantic tags. In particular, check out the tutorials section, where they demonstrate how a screen reader parses web pages.
* ANDI Free Accessibility Testing Tool: [https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html)
Do NOT use this as a one-stop shop to test for accessibility. In the end, you are responsible for ensuring compliance with accessibility standards. This tool only tests compliance with Section 508, a set of standards developed for federally-funded site accessibility. It does not necessarily imply compliance with WCAG or accessibility as a general concept.
* WebAIM Contrast Checker Tool: [https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
This tool is great because it tells you whether you are passing WCAG contrast guidelines!
* Great Slideshow on Usability by UVA's own Professor Praphamontripong: [http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~up3f/cs4640/slides/4640meet03A-UsabilityPrinciples.pdf](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~up3f/cs4640/slides/4640meet03A-UsabilityPrinciples.pdf)

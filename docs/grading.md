# 🏆 Grading & XP Breakdown (Project-Related)

Your project grade will be based on team documents, sprint deliverables, the final product, and peer evaluation.  
All items are graded on the **XP system** (1000 XP scale for the course).  
Project-related work accounts for **650 XP**.

| Item                                   | XP Value |
|----------------------------------------|----------|
| 📄 Project Requirements Document       | 100 XP (50 doc + 50 team eval) |
| 📄 Change Impact Report                | 100 XP (50 doc + 50 team eval) |
| 📄 Beta Testing Report                 | 100 XP (50 doc + 50 team eval) |
| 🚀 Sprint 1 – Setup & Team Formation   | 25 XP |
| 🚀 Sprint 2 – Requirements Elicitation | 25 XP |

| 🚀 Sprint 4 – Core Feature + Amazon S3 | 25 XP |
| 🚀 Sprint 5 – Requirements Change      | 25 XP |
| 🚀 Sprint 6 – Beta Release & Testing   | 25 XP |
| 🏁 Final Project Deliverable           | 100 XP |
| 👥 Final Team Evaluation               | 100 XP |
| **Total Project XP**                   | **650 XP** |

## 📄 Team Documents
You will prepare three major documents during the semester. Each is graded both on its **quality** (50 XP) and on **team evaluation** (50 XP) reflecting collaboration and contribution balance.

1. **Project Requirements Document**  
   - Captures your sustainability problem domain, stakeholders, and detailed user stories.  
   - *Grading guidelines:* clarity, completeness of user stories, evidence of user input, feasibility.

2. **Change Impact Report**  
   - Written after the mid-semester requirements change. Describes the change, its rationale, and how your design and implementation adapt.  
   - *Grading guidelines:* clear explanation of impact, thoughtful adaptation, evidence of team discussion.

3. **Beta Testing Report**  
   - Written after peer testing of your beta release. Summarizes test results, issues discovered, and planned fixes.  
   - *Grading guidelines:* quality of testing process, coverage of features, insightfulness of analysis, actionable plans.

## 🚀 Sprint Deliverables
Each sprint is worth **25 XP**. At the end of each sprint, your team must show your current progress to your TA and submit a short progress update.  
- *Grading guidelines:* expected features working, visible incremental progress, consistent GitHub activity, functional deployment.

## 🏁 Final Project Deliverable
The final project deliverable is worth 100 XP. Please note that for this course, the journey is more important than the destination. This is why the sprint scores are worth more (in aggregate) than the final site itself. Like the other assessments in this course, grading is overall holistic - that is, there is no specific point-for-point breakdown for the rubric. One reason for this is that this is simply not how software is delivered in real-life. There are basically only four outcomes:

- You meet the expectations of the customer within reason and both parties are satisfied with the outcome;
- You exceed the expectations of the customer, potentially generating more good will, a good reference, or more future business;
- You do not quite meet the expectations of the customer, leaving some room for improvement;
- You ship a system that simply does not work to the expectations of the customer.

We will grade your projects in a similar vein, with some flexibility for minor adjustments.

Thus, the grading levels will be:

    Above and Beyond - Min XP: 100 / Max XP: 105
    Complete - Min XP: 85 / Max XP: 100
    Lacking - Min XP: 60 / Max XP: 85
    Insufficient - Min XP: 0 / Max XP: 60

Aspects that will determine the exact grade within a range include but are not limited to:

- UI design
- Overall flow of application
- Special features
- Obvious bugs that should have been corrected
- Polish

## 👥 Final Team Evaluation
Worth **100 XP**. Each team member will evaluate their peers confidentially.  
- Evaluations may affect both **individual and team XP**.  
- *Grading guidelines:* strong participation rewarded, weak contributions may reduce individual XP.
